For people who don't now. I've created [ranza](http://github/raphamorim/ranza) for check unusable dependencies. Why? To avoid accumulation of dependencies that are not being used....

<!-- more -->

The Ranza initially was using **fs** module to read files and apply an regex in all data to catch all requires in that file. Working only for Nodejs projects.

Well, in that time I don't realized wich using that technique for get all requires in the file/project was a problem.

### Why?

I've made a good regex. It've work for regular (most) cases. But regex  is dump. This technicle only will work for cases who I know. So with time I realized other cases, other ways to require a dependency. And  EVERY TIME I update and improve the regex (Dear Lord, it was so much boring).

**I can't trust in my own logic, even with tests**, cause every week a discover new things, new ways to apply a require. This things made ranza unstable.

The time has passed and I realized: "Well, this project will never work for ES6". That's sucks, cause my idea for futures releases is ranza work to client-side dependencies too (like an uncss for JS).

So, a friend of mine tell me for use [Abstract Syntax Three (AST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) to get the requires callers. The idea is amazing, it's solve all my problems and I can remove the regex.

So I use a Reflect node module to made the AST. But this module is current working only for ES3. What's means? In cases which missing ";" and "{/}" in syntax, it's not works (ES4/ES5). Awww man, and now?

Besides this problems, I wanted Ranza working for ES6 too (using import instead require). So I've a another idea when I look the babel-core (a ES6 compiler). I'll transform ES6 code into ES5, so later I fix problems with syntax for ES3 support.

But I found a pot of gold.

In babel-core exists a **parser** method. Which convert ES6, ES5 code syntax in AST. So I decided reuse this method in ranza and now my project is stable. I've no fear for using this module.

From now, the changes in ranza is only for improvements and bugs fixes (I guess te-hehehe) <3
