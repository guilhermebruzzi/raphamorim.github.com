I started using vim just occasionally and I recently found myself using it almost all the time — although there are some peculiarity of Sublime Text and Atom I still use.

Here is what I learned so far:

### Learning Curve

I felt the difference between vim and other editors in short time. Vim's learning curve is something to stand out.

At the beginning, it was quite difficult, to be honest. Everything you are used to do on other editors becomes different. You have to relearn basic things like creating a new line and deleting a word "The Vim Way". But I kept using it.

I was determined to continue using Vim, reading more about it and learning tricks. I ook me a while to get used to using Vim’s shortcuts, but I really like that now. It feels like playing some game when I use "vim combos" in keyboard. Damn! This is really cool.

### Oh! you are really fast

Something obvious is the speed of vim to open or edit some file. But vim isn't about speed, neither anything related with this. It's about practicality. Vim lets you can edit so fast any file/project using terminal.

Now you need not wait for the editor to be able to open that little quick change to the file.

### Fully hackable

It is one of the few code editors allow you to configure shortcuts, syntax, text format and so much more. Its fully changeable.

Perhaps the coolest thing I’ve done in this little time was looking for new shortcuts and tricks to my Vimrc. I ended up seeing many Vimrc from many awesome devs.

### Think more before do anything

Think more before doing anything At first things were complicated. I did not know many shortcuts. I was taking quite a lot to make even small changes. I had to think more on what was going to do.
